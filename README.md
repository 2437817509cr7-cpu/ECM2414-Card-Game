# ECM2414 Software Development – Card Game Simulation

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the ECM2414 Software Development module (2025/26).  
The goal is to design and implement a **multi-threaded card game** in Java that follows the object-oriented paradigm and basic software engineering principles.  

Each player and deck operates as an independent thread, and the game ends when one player obtains four cards of the same value.  
The program handles input validation, file output, and thread synchronisation between players and decks.
